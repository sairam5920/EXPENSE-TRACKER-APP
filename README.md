"" I have developed an 'EXPENSE TRACKER APP' using HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. Actually this is non coding topic but to improve my skills I done in coding way.I used platforms like vscode and codepen for write this codes ,this gives me a wonderful experience and I enjoed a lot . This app allows users to record descriptions,expensive,date of birth .
but i didn't write code for list of expenses and summary because of I don't have that much knowledge,I tried but the webpage is getting different and searched for source but no use . so, I sincerely apologize for what I ahve done ,i think this will enough for beginners like me.hope that you can forgive me.""
